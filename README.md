# Brownian-Motion
This repo contains the code used for the project done in LU3PY122

## Goals

1. Simulate random walks of particles on a 1D line
2. Brownian motion with free particles to check equation resolution implementation 
- vary D to see the effect on the variance of the position during time
3. Add external forces to the particles
a. Harmonic potential
- link between $\tau$ and the spring constant $k$
b. Double well potential
- mean time to escape one well Arrhenius law
- link to boltzmann distribution
4. Convergence time and limit boundaries
