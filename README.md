# Brownian-Motion
This repo contains the code used for the project done in LU3PY122

## Goals

1. Simulate random walks of particles on a 1D line
2. Brownian motion with free particles to check equation resolution implementation 
- vary D to see the effect on the variance of the position during time
3. Add external forces to the particles

a. Harmonic potential
- link between $\tau$ and the spring constant $k$

b. Double well potential
- mean time to escape one well Arrhenius law
- link to boltzmann distribution
4. Convergence time


5. Take only the time of jumping instead of all its positions to find the argmax

6. Compare the results with Einstein relation and and verify Arrhenius law 


7. Plot speeds and compare it to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

8. Take a colored noise instead of a white noise and compare it to the intertia equation

9. Add 2 links between 2 particles (spring)
