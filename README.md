# Brownian-Motion
This repo contains the code used for the project done in LU3PY122

## Goals

1. Simulate random walks of particles on a 1D line
2. Brownian motion with free particles to check equation resolution implementation 
3. Add external forces to the particles
4. Convergence time and limit boundaries
